# Context
This project is done as part of the Decision Making with Programming and Analytics module. 
# Introduction
The impact of Covid-19 on the Singapore economy has been significant. Sectors that have been the most severely affected are those that rely on International Travel, including air transport, accomodation and other tourism-related sectors. Consumer-facing sectors such as retail and food services have also been badly affected.
# Problem Statement
How has the Covid-19 pandemic affected the Singapore tourism sector?
# Datasets
We looked into the datasets of Number of Covid-19 cases in Singapore, Total Outbound Departures of Singapore Residents, International Visitors and Tourism Receipts between Dec 2019 to Aug 2020.
# Explanatory Variable
Number of Covid-19 cases in Singapore
# Response Variables
1. Total Outbound Departures of Singapore Residents
2. International Visitors
3. Tourism Receipts
# Solution
We came up with a command line interface program called E-agency. The main objective of E-agency is to keep users constantly updated on the newest deals for local attractions, plan their
itinerary while & providing activity and dining recommendations
